# Google Calendar API
Web App to try out Google Calendar API


Simple web app which shows a user a list of meetings on their Google Calendar and the time in minutes spent on those days 
in these meetings. For simplicity, I have hardcoded the dates (March 6th to March 13th 2017) and not implemented a logout feature. 

Hosted on Heroku: https://googleclndr.herokuapp.com

Found Issue: App fails sometimes in normal browser, incognito works. Will investigate it.


To run:
```
npm start
run localhost:8000
```

To start unit test runner (karma-jasmine):
```
npm test
```
